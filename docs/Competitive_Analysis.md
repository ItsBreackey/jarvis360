# Jarvis360 — Competitive Analysis & Recommendations

Date: 2025-10-16

## Executive summary
Jarvis360 is a lightweight product analytics + forecasting tool focused on monthly MRR, churn risk scoring, and simple forecasting. Competing SaaS include ProfitWell, Baremetrics, ChartMogul, Mixpanel/Amplitude, and smaller forecasting tools. Jarvis360 should focus on: fast time-to-insight, approachable UX, prescriptive what-if simulation, and explainable forecasts — all at lower friction and cost than enterprise tooling.

## Short-term (MVP additions)
- Demo data & 1-click onboarding so users see results instantly.
- Explainability panel: model type, parameters, training window, and simple guidance.
- Streaming-hash and memoization to improve UI responsiveness for large datasets.
- One-click exports (PNG/CSV/JSON) and scenario sharing (localStorage-based) to encourage viral usage.

## Mid-term (Differentiators)
- Integrations: Stripe, Chargebee, QuickBooks, HubSpot (OAuth + scheduled sync).
- Scenario collaboration & sharing (team features, named scenarios).
- Cohort and segmentation analytics tied to what-if simulations.
- Scheduled reports and alerts (email/push) for anomalies and MRR changes.

## Long-term (Platform advantages)
- Prescriptive recommendations (discount/engagement suggestions with ROI estimates).
- Model monitoring, anomaly detection, and drift detection.
- Marketplace/SDK for plugins, embeddable widgets, and third-party models.
- Enterprise features: SSO, audit logs, compliance (SOC2) when needed.

## Quick wins (48–72 hours)
- Add demo dataset + Load Demo button and onboarding modal.
- Add Explain Forecast panel with human-friendly text.
- Implement streaming FNV-1a hash and a small benchmark test.
- Add a Save/Share scenario UX backed by localStorage.

## Roadmap (30/60/90 days)
- 0–30 days: demo + onboarding, explain panel, streaming-hash, scenario sharing, docs.
- 30–60 days: integrations MVP, cohorts, scheduled reports, E2E tests.
- 60–90+ days: prescriptive playbooks, model selection/autotune, early enterprise controls.

## Go-to-market suggestions
- Freemium/trial tier with CSV upload + one saved scenario.
- Target early SaaS founders and SMB subscription businesses.
- Content and partnerships: publish a reproducible “How to forecast MRR” guide and pursue Stripe/Chargebee listings.

## Implementation notes
- Key files: `client/src/App.jsx`, `client/src/utils/forecast.js`, `client/src/utils/csv.js`, docs in `docs/`.
- Use localStorage (`jarvis_saved_scenarios_v1`, `jarvis_autosave_whatif_v1`) for initial sharing and persistence.
